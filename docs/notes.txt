A Jenkins node that has pipelines to execute ansible-playbooks on all target nodes. These playbooks should execute a 
command that is taken as a variable in the jenkins pipeline.

Two jobs for the Jenkins:

1) Job for all target nodes:
  - This executes an ansible-playbook on all target nodes.
  - The job has 1 variable:
    - command: <The command to be executed on all target nodes)
  - This variable is passed to the ansible-playbook which then gets executed on all target nodes

2) Job for a specific target node:
  - This executes an ansible-playbook on a specified targed node.
  - The job has 2 variables:
    - target: <The name of the target we want to execute the playbook for, either fqdn, ip or just a name>
    - command: <The command to be executed on the target node>
  - These variables are passed to the ansible-playbook which then gets executed on the specified target nodes

One more idea of a job (Execute playbook on multiple specified target nodes)
